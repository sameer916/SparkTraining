    "## Overview of REST APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us get an overview of REST APIs. REST based APIs are extensively used for building large scale applications.\n",
    "* REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**.\n",
    "* It is extensively used to build modern applications as it simplifies the process of building complex and large scale applications.\n",
    "* Here are the use cases where REST APIs are extensively used.\n",
    "  * Mobile applications\n",
    "  * Web applications\n",
    "  * Data integration between multiple applications\n",
    "* For mobile and web applications, we typically develop frontend and backend separately and integrate them over REST.\n",
    "* Here are the commonly used REST based requests.\n",
    "  * GET - Get the data from the backend\n",
    "  * POST - Insert or update the data in the backend\n",
    "  * PUT - Update the data in the backend\n",
    "  * DELETE - Delete the data in the backend\n",
    "* As part of data engineering projects, we typically use REST to get the data from external applications.\n",
    "* If required, we can take care of authentication and authorization by leveraging **Headers** while placing the requests.\n",
    "* Let us see an example using GitHub REST APIs. As a developer you might want to do the following:\n",
    "  * Get your repositories or public repositories. You can place **GET** request from external applications.\n",
    "  * Create a new repository under your GitHub Account. You can place **POST** request from external application.\n",
    "  * Delete an existing repository under your GitHub Account. You can place **DELETE** request form external application.\n",
    "* Here are different ways you can validate REST APIs without getting into programming.\n",
    "  * Using browser (it might not work for complex requests)\n",
    "  * Using `curl` command.\n",
    "  * Using a client based utility called as **postman**."
